    <p>The San Francisco State Experimental College was founded in 1965 and ended in 1968. It was originally a place for students to teach classes for themselves, sparked out of the lack of education in regards to a Black studies department. Students gained accreditation via sponsorships from faculty members. The California State College administration closed the Experimental College in the Fall of 1968 after the beginning of a major strike. It was revived in 2017.</p>

    <p>There are many testimonies over what the EC was. You will find that many faculty and administration alike show contempt and dismissal towards EXCO today. But others appreciate it too. This is a college within a college. Our most direct issue, as students, is education. It is the choice you have towards every fundamental reason for being here at this university.</p> 
    
    <p>Information constantly passes through us. It's exhausting to retain it all and keep building upon it over and over. But know that you weren't the first to engage in this service, and you will not be the last. This is what it means to grow as a human.</p>
