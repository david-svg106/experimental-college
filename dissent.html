    <p>This is not a debate club. This is an experiment, an accredited experiment backed by the Division of Undergraduate Education and Academic Planning at San Francisco State University. If you join this class, it will appear on your transcript.</p>
    <p>People have been discussing issues--all issues--since the beginning of civilization. We are in the age where information is readily available at our fingertips at all times. Some of us take for granted the internet's power to educate, others appreciate it too much. So much, that it corrupts every opinion they have. That everything they believe must have a factual link based on internet or artificially intelligent proof.</p>
    <p>Answer this question honestly: do you make your own opinions? If you could shred your identity down to simply knowing that you are a walking object among other walking and non-walking objects, what do you believe then? It's impossible to know, unless you already know it. It's not something the internet, AI, or most of your friends or family could answer. Because if that source means anything to you in the first place, the information is already poisoned.</p>
    <p>I invite you to set aside the notions of familiarity. Come in blind, and prove to yourself that you really believe in what you believe.</p>
