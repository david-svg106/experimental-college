    <h2>Digital Defense 101</h2>
    <p>EXCO 301.11 CRN: 6377 Tuesdays from 3:00-4:40pm starting February 3rd</p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Joseph and I am teaching a new Experimental College (EXCO) course @ SFSU Called (EXCO 301.11) Digital Defense 101: A Proactive Guide to Staying Safe Online.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I love to explore the world of security and cyber threats, and if you have similar interests, this course is perfect for you. If you are a free speech advocate, or someone who does not like surveillance, or someone who would like to learn best practices when using computers or smartphones, this class is also for you. It does NOT require a prior knowledge of Computer Science, programming, or cybersecurity because this class is not any of those things. It is a beginner friendly, curated crash course, where we identify and mitigate risks online.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My class starts next week, Tuesdays @ 3pm-4:40om. The exact place is TBD, so please join my Discord or enroll in this (1-3) unit course to get the update.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm also going to record all "lectures" or demonstrations to a YouTube channel, if you are interested but don't want to enroll.</p>
