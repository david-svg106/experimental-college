    <p>As a student of Dissent, it is your job to speak. Given a large enough class size, the instructor will not engage in the dicussion, but rather facilitate one or multiple discussions between students.</p>
    <p>No one will be permitted to record, and all phones will be left in our backpacks at the door. If you must access your phone, you will need to leave the room and place it back in your backpack when you return.</p>
    <p>You are not obligated to stay the full length of the class. If you are enrolled and demonstrate commitment, you will receive an A. If you are not committed, you will receive a C. If you never show up, you'll receive an F.</p>

    <p>Below are a list of topics I encourage you to discuss</p>
    <ul style="line-height:1.5;">
        <li>Are you honest?</li>
            <ul><li>What is a lie? What is deception? What is a mistake? An error?</li>
                <li>Are you you? Are you somebody else? Have you invented your own language?</li>
                <li>Is you one thing? Is you many things? Is every thing of you honest? Is it honest to yourself? Is it honest in the eyes of others?</li>

            <ul><li>How do you categorize things? Have you thought about a pattern to describe the way you understand patterns?</li>
                <li>Many people in the past did not live beyond 18. If you died now and had a moment to look back at every single thing you did, would you be satisfied with that life? Would you be unsatisfied? Are you indifferent?</li>
                <li>What don't you know? What does it mean to know? How are you supposed to know? Do you know because others say so? Do you know because you trust your sources of information? What information have you obtained internally?</>
                <li>Is what you know what you are?</li>
                <li>Is being you a choice?</li>
                <li>If you was a book, is the writer conscious or subconscious? Are there two writers? Are there twenty different writers? Are your parents writers? Are your friends? Strangers? Laws? Historians? Lawyers?</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Is this the person you think about when you are bored? Would you invite them to spend time with you?
                    <br>Or are you waiting for them to ask you?</li>
                <li>Would you invite them to your wedding? Would you ask them to be your person of honor?</li>
                <li>Do you trust them with your life? Do you expect them to care for you physically, mentally, and spiritually?</li>
                <li>Is anyone expected to care for you mentally, physically, spiritually? Partially?</li>
                <li>Have you seen people's emotions here? Where are their emotions? Do you ever want to cry here? Have you witnessed anyone ever cry?
                    <br>Have you witnessed anyone dance? Have you witnessed anyone scream?</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Take a break from reading these. Gather your thoughts, the instructor is poisoning your mind with his line of thinking</p>
    <p>Speak to yourself. Talk to yourself Have a brief or long conversation with you</p>
    <p>You are not your enemy. You are honest with you. Right? Wrong?</p>
