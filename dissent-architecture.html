    <p>As a student of Dissent, it is your job to speak. Given a large enough class size, the instructor will not engage in the dicussion, but rather facilitate one or multiple discussions between students.</p>
    <p>No one will be permitted to record, and all phones will be left in our backpacks at the door. If you must access your phone, you will need to leave the room and place it back in your backpack when you return.</p>
    <p>You are not obligated to stay the full length of the class. If you are enrolled and demonstrate commitment, you will receive an A. If you are not committed, you will receive a C. If you never show up, you'll receive an F.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Below are a list of topics I encourage you to discuss</p>

            </ul>
        <li>How many people at this school do you <b>know</b>?</li>
            <ul><li>You define what it means to know somebody.</li>
                <li>Could you recall simple things like their name, where they've come from, and what their major is?</li>
                <li>Is this the person you think about when you are bored? Would you invite them to spend time with you?</li>
            </ul>
